## GoIT Node.js Course Template Homework

Fork this repository to work on your homework assignments (2-6). Forking will create a repository on your GitHub account at http://github.com

Add your mentor as a collaborator.

For each homework assignment, create a new branch.

- hw02
- hw03
- hw04
- hw05
- hw06

Each new branch for an assignment should be created from the master branch.

After completing a homework assignment on your branch, create a pull request (PR). Then, add your mentor for code review. Only after the mentor approves the PR can you merge the homework branch into the master branch.

Carefully read your mentor's comments. Address the feedback and make commits to your homework branch. Changes will automatically appear in the PR after you push the commit with corrections to GitHub. After making corrections, add your mentor for code review again.

- When submitting a homework assignment, provide the link to the PR.
- The JavaScript code is clean and understandable, with formatting done using Prettier.

### Commands:

- `npm start` &mdash; starts the server in production mode
- `npm run start:dev` &mdash; starts the server in development mode
- `npm run lint` &mdash; runs ESLint to check the code; perform this before each PR and correct all linting errors
- `npm lint:fix` &mdash; same as above, but also automatically fixes simple errors.
